So, this is a thing we are trying build. 
See the idea.txt first to get the brief. 
We don;t know ml and stuff. So, we tried to do in this way. 
We have a basic chatbot and a scrap.js service that gives output.json but its too less data. I guess we have to extract all the data from the urls listed in the file.

Now, I have to full-fill the idea anyhoow and want to build a winning project. 
You have access to all what i have. 

More context - 
Do whatever you want to restrcuturing.
I also need a professional name, logo, and a minimal ai product landing page.  colours - light them with cyan will be good ig. and something related to india and isro also in it. like in elements. 

Make sure you not baic fonts. use something cool and amaing. 

and then the functionality is the main things.
