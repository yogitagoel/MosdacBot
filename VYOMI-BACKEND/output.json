The three-axis stabilized geostationary satellite carries two meteorological instruments: a six channel Imager and an IR Sounder. Along with the channels in Visible, Middle Infrared, Water Vapor and Thermal Infrared bands, the Imager includes a SWIR channel for wider applications. The Sounder will have eighteen narrow spectral channels in three IR bands in addition to a channel in visible band. It also has a Data Relay Transponder and Satellite based Search & Rescue Payload. Several innovative technologies like on-the-fly correction of scan mirror pointing errors, biannual yaw rotation of the spacecraft, micro-stepping SADA, star sensors and integrated bus management unit have been incorporated to meet the stringent payload requirements like pointing accuracies, thermal management of IR detectors and concurrent operation of both instruments.A passive radiant cooler is used to cool the infrared detectors of imager and sounder instruments. The temperature of the detectors is maintained at 95 K (BOL) and 100 K (EOL). The passive cooler also maintains the sounder filter wheel temperature at 213 K.",

    "content1": "The satellite has 3 payloads:Meteorological PayloadThe INSAT-3DR spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.IMAGERThe INSAT-3DR imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.The Imager is an improved design of VHRR-2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. The INSAT-3DR Imager payload is a replica of INSAT-3D Imager.Key Parameters of the ImagerSOUNDERThe INSAT-3DR sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands alongwith one visible band. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional maps of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.The Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount. The INSAT-3DR Sounder payload is a replica of INSAT-3D Sounder.Key Parameters of the sounderSpectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder Communication PayloadCommunication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services. A total satellite mass of 2211kg is considered for the launch compatibility, and 70 kg (approximately) of mass apportionment is done for the communication payload components. The communication payload components are - Meteorological Transmitter, Data Relay Transponder, Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Transponder & S-band Broadcast Satellite Services Transponder.",

The three-axis stabilized geostationary satellite carries two meteorological instruments: a six channel Imager and an IR Sounder. Along with the channels in Visible, Middle Infrared, Water Vapor and Thermal Infrared bands, the Imager includes a SWIR channel for wider applications. The Sounder will have eighteen narrow spectral channels in three IR bands in addition to a channel in visible band. It also has a Data Relay Transponder and Satellite based Search & Rescue Payload. Several innovative technologies like on-the-fly correction of scan mirror pointing errors, biannual yaw rotation of the spacecraft, micro-stepping SADA, star sensors and integrated bus management unit have been incorporated to meet the stringent payload requirements like pointing accuracies, thermal management of IR detectors and concurrent operation of both instruments.A passive radiant cooler is used to cool the infrared detectors of imager and sounder instruments. The detectors temperature is maintained at 95 K (BOL) and 100 K (EOL). The passive cooler is also to maintain the sounder filter wheel temperature at 213 K.",

    "content1": "The satellite has 3 payloads:Meteorological PayloadThe INSAT-3D spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.IMAGERThe INSAT-3D imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.The Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors.Key Parameters of the ImagerSOUNDERThe INSAT-3D sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.The Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.Key Parameters of the sounderSpectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder Communication Payload Communication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services. A total satellite mass of 2000kg is considered for the launch compatibility, and 70 kg (approximately) of mass apportionment is done for the communication payload components. The communication payload components are - Meteorological Transmitter, Data Relay Transponder, Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Transponder & S-band Broadcast Satellite Services Transponder.",

This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management.Metsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a lift–off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries.",

MetSat has been designed using a new spacecraft bus (I-1000 bus) employing lightweight structural elements like CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic). A central structural thrust cylinder provides mounting interfaces propellant tanks, pressurant tank, equipment panels, payload, solar array assembly, and with the launch vehicle.Structural brackets are provided to mount momentum wheels, reaction wheel, RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, earth sensors, sun sensors, LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor), and propulsion components.MetSat-1 is three-axis stabilized (momentum biased control subsystem). However, unlike its INSAT predecessors, the MetSat-1 spacecraft does not feature a sail/boom design. The attitude is sensed by suite of sensors (gyros, Earth sensors, digital sun sensor, coarse analog sun sensors, and solar panel sun sensor). Magnetic torquers serve as actuators to unload the momentum of the wheels. In addition, active thrusters are used (one 440N LAM for orbit raising maneuvers and eight 22 N thrusters for orbit and attitude control).The propulsion system employed is a unified bi-propellant with mono-methyl hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. The S/C employs passive thermal control system by utilizing multi-layer insulation blankets, optical solar reflectors, heat sinks, paints, thermal grease, thermal shields etc. The temperature of individual subsystems spread over the satellite is maintained by a bank of 112 heaters.EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): Electrical power of 550 W is generated by a single panel solar array of 2.15 m x 1.85 m using GaAS solar cells. The solar panel features a drive mechanism to point it into the sun. A single NiCd battery (18 Ah capacity) provides power for eclipse phases. The SADA (Solar Array Driver Assembly) slip rings and drive mechanism are modified to meet the power transfer and drive requirements, it is mass-optimized.The spacecraft has a launch mass of 1055 kg including 560 kg of propellant (495 kg S/C dry mass). MetSat-1 has a design life of 7 years with an operational goal of 10 years.",

The VHRR observes in VIS, water vapor and TIR bands providing a spatial resolution of 2 km in VIS band and 8 km for the rest. VHRR was developed by SAC (Satellite Application Center), Ahmedabad, India. The instrument operates in three scanning modes:The nominal frame repetition rates are: 40, 30 and 20 minutes respectively. VHRR is an opto-mechanical system (whiskbroom type imager). The incoming solar radiation is reflected onto a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 20 cm aperture by a beryllium scan mirror mounted at 45° to the optical axis. The optical system includes a gold-film dichoric beam-splitter that transmits visible light energy and reflects WV/TIR energy, so that the radiation from the Earth is channelized to the visible and IR focal planes simultaneously.The visible band detector configuration consists of two staggered arrays of four silicon photodiodes each; while two sets of mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector elements operating nominally at 100-110 K sense the WV/thermal radiation. The scan mirror is mounted on a two-axis, gimballed scan mechanism system to generate a 2-D image by sweeping the detector instantaneous field of view (FOV) across the Earth's surface in east to west (fast scan) and north to south (slow scan).Imaging modes of the VHRR instrumentImaging modes of the VHRR instruments Schematic illustration of the VHRR instrumentVHRR InstrumentDRT (Data Relay Transponder)The DRT (Data Relay Transponder) is part of a DCS (Data Collection System) of ISRO. The objective is to collect data from unattended meteorological platforms in the ground segment. DRT receives receives signals from unattended weather data collection platforms and retransmits them to the central station. The data from these payloads are being used for comprehensive weather status and forecasting.RF communication of DRT: Uplink frequency = 402.75 MHz; downlink frequency = 4506.05 MHz; bandwidth =± 100 kHz; EIRP = 21 dBW (min).Note: MetSat-1 does not carry SAS&R (Satellite Aided Search and Rescue) system. In the INSAT-2 series, the INSAT-2A and -2B satellites carried SAS&R transponders as well as DRTs (Data Relay Transponders).

    "content1": "The tropical belt receives more energy from Sun than it radiates back into space. The excess energy is transported to temperate regions by the motion of atmosphere and oceans. Any variation in the energy budget of the tropics will therefore effect the whole planet. The energy exchanges are strongly linked to the water cycle and particularly to the tropical connective systems: huge amount of latent heat are released in the tropical rains, while high humidity and thick clouds strongly affect the radiation budget. Many interactions between radiation, water vapour, clouds, precipitation and atmospheric motion determine the life cycle of convective cloud systems, and the occurrence of extreme events like tropical cyclones, monsoons, flood and droughts. Due to dynamic nature of above parameters, the frequency of observation from low orbiting sun-synchronous orbits is inadequate. Only geo-stationary satellites allow continuous monitoring of the Tropics, but their Vis-IR sensors give limited information on the cloud surface properties or horizontal distribution of water vapour.Low orbiting (~800 km) satellites with low inclinations provide high repetitivity. An inclination at 20 degrees provides 6 observations of each point on the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The most energetic tropical systems, such as the cloud clusters of ITCZ, the Monsoon systems and the Tropical cyclones, extend over hundreds of kilometers. Hence, a ground resolution of about 10 km is adequate for these observations.In order to meet most of the above requirements, Megha Tropiques has been envisaged which is low earth orbit (LEO) mission. Megha in Sanskrit is ‘cloud’ and Tropiques in French is ‘tropics’. Megha-tropiques Mission is an ISRO-CNES (Indo-French) collaborative programme intended for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics using a satellite platform.Megha-Tropiques is a one-tonne satellite which will be operated as part of a joint programme between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and France′s Centre National d′Etudes Spaciales (CNES). The spacecraft was constructed by ISRO, based around the IRS bus developed for earlier Indian satellites, and carries four instruments which will be used to study the Earth′s atmosphere.ISRO is responsible of the system and the satellite. ISRO provides the launcher, the paltform, part of the MADRAS instrument, the GPS receiver and the mission operation center, which will process all the products until level 1. ISRO also performs the integration and test of the MADRAS instrument, of the complete payload and of the satellite.CNES provides a support for the system activities, the hyperfrequency part of the MADRAS instrument (MARFEQ) developped under contract by ASTRIUM, and the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments developped by CNES with a support of the LMD, LERMA and CETP laboratories. CNES also provides the data processing algorithms for the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments and participates to the development of the MADRAS data processing algorithms. A data and instruments performances expertise center will be created in France. For the French part, the level 2 and upper data processing will be realised in the thematic center Icare.Megha Tropiques Ground SegmentThe ground segment is divided into:1. A satellite operation ground segment providedby India: an S-band telemetry and command station a satellite monitoring and control center2. A science ground segment including Indian and French parts: an S-band mission station for payload telemetry located in India a mission operation center located in India a level-2 processing center in India such as MOSDAC a level-2 processing center named ICARE in FranceThe Megha-Tropiques satellite is launched by an Indian PSLV launcher in 2011, on a 867 km orbit with an inclination of 20°.",

The radiometer is designed to estimate atmospheric water parameters and wind speed in the equatorial belt. The choice of the channels has been driven by their potential contribution to the measurement of the parameters defined above.Geophysical Parameters SAPHIR microwave humidity sounder and radiometerThe mission specifications call for determination of humidity with an accuracy of 10 to 20 percent in 5 to 7 layers of the troposphere, over 10 km pixels. For realizing that performance, it is necessary to choose channels for which the atmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the troposphere. This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour by channels more or less close to the centre of the line. A candidate line, already chosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz. It is possible to get contribution functions peaking from heights of 2 km.up to 10 to 12 km in tropical redundant to use more than 5 channels. A sixth complimentary channel in a window regions has to be used to correct for the surface effects in the lowest channels; the 150 channel of MADRAS can be used for that. This is the principle of SAPHIR instrument, which has been studied in the frame of micro satellites.Geophysical Parameters ScaRaB- Broadband radiation measurement instrumentSCARAB is a four channel instrument mainly measuring in Visible (Sc1), InfraRed (Sc4) along with Solar Radiation (Sc2) and Total Radiation (Sc3). The long-wave irradiance is deduced from the difference between Sc3 and Sc2 measurements. Channels in Visible and IR window, Sc1 and Sc4 are used for scene identification (surface, clouds, partially covered) and for assuring compatibility and comparisons with the images from operational satellites.Geophysical Parameters ROSA Radio Occultation SensorGPS Radio Occultation sensor enables measurement of water vapour and temperature profiles in the tropics. GPS ROS payload is there to supplement / complement the mission for the atmospheric studies. A GPS ROS payload, ROSA (GPS-ROS) provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), is configured as the fourth payload.",

Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc",

Two are Indian and one is from the Italian Space Agency.Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM)OCM is an 8-band multi-spectral camera operating in the Visible and Near IR spectral range. This camera provides an instantaneous geometric field of view of 360 meter and a swath of 1420 km. OCM can be tilted up to + 20 degree along track.Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT)SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.900 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.600 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA)ROSA is a new GPS occultation receiver provided by ASI (Italian Space Agency). The objective is to characterize the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, opening the possibilities for the development of several scientific activities exploiting these new radio occultation data sets.",

    "content1": "The satellite has 3 payloads:Meteorological PayloadThe INSAT-3DS spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.IMAGERThe INSAT-3DS imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.The Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors.Key Parameters of the ImagerSOUNDERThe INSAT-3DS sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.The Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.Key Parameters of the sounderSpectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder Communication Payload Communication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services. A total satellite mass of 2000kg is considered for the launch compatibility, and 70 kg (approximately) of mass apportionment is done for the communication payload components. The communication payload components are - Meteorological Transmitter, Data Relay Transponder, Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Transponder & S-band Broadcast Satellite Services Transponder.",

It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 25 x 25 km. The parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.900 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.600 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.",

          "Megha- Tropiques (MT) is a joint Indo-French collaborative satellite mission, which is launched on 12 October 2011. The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget and Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels. A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation."

The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications.

          "Lagrangian technique is used for generating high-resolution sea surface salinity fields in the Bay of Bengal. This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically."

          "Abstract",
          "SARAL, a joint ISRO-CNES satellite mission, was successfully launched in 2013. It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product."
